      2. Shivaji -The Great Maratha
  </h2>

  <p class="right">
              I have read Shivaji - the great maratha. It's a wonderful book. It is simply written - very little hyperbole. <br> 
             brings out the true Shivaji the person as also the king. Shivajis strategy, cunning, bravery, humanism, patriotism <br> 
             and keen intellect are on display for all to see. His yearning for Hindva Swaraj and the focus he brings among the <br>
              people and galvanises them for the cause is amazing. Not a gripping book in the conventional sense as the book is <br>
               written in fairly straight forward narrative which moves from event to event and can even look a bit disjointed & <br>
             loosely strung. But this is still a good read just to know Shivaji... the great maratha for sure!

             Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the <br>
             second novel in the Harry Potter series. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft <br>
            and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the "Chamber of <br>
             Secrets" has been opened and that the "heir of Slytherin" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. <br>
              These threats are found after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his <br>
               friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks.
